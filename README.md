## Project Overview
This research investigates the psychological, social, and environmental factors that drive individuals toward hacking activities. Through analysis of motivations, behaviors, and systemic influences, we explore pathways to redirect hacking talent toward ethical cybersecurity and national digital defense.

## Research Goals
1. Understand why hackers ignore legal and ethical boundaries
2. Analyze emotional drivers (rejection, revenge, recognition)
3. Explore the appeal of offensive vs. defensive security
4. Propose sustainable solutions for talent redirection
5. Develop frameworks for national cyber militia models
