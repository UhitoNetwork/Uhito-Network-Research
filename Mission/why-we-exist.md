# Why We Exist

Uhito Network exists to create something helpful for everyone.

We are a research‑driven initiative with a single goal: **to fix what is broken** in the relationship between hackers, the community, companies, and governments.

- **For the community:** We help people avoid sharing their informations, getting robbed, or falling victim to dark arts. We speak in simple language so everyone understands the threats.
- **For hackers:** We guide them before they cross the line – or help them find a way back if they're already in the dark. We use research to understand who they are, what they do, how they talk, and what drives them. Then we craft reverse‑engineering messages that turn them toward ethics.
- **For companies:** We create a pool of skilled, self‑taught individuals who have proven themselves through volunteer work and documented progress. Companies get interested in them because they see real experience, not just certificates. Our research also offers companies short solutions to their security challenges.
- **For governments:** We help build a pipeline of ethical hackers who can be trusted to work in government programs. By guiding hackers to ethics, we give governments talent they can use instead of trap.

We are here to bridge all sides. We are here to help, not harm. We are here to fix.
