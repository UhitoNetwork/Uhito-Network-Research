# Who We Serve

We serve four groups, because helping one group alone is not enough.

## 1. The Community
Everyday people who don't know how the dark arts work. We give them clear warnings, real scenarios, and simple language to understand threats. We help them avoid sharing个人信息 and getting robbed.

## 2. Hackers
Those who walk the path – from curious beginners to those already deep in the underground. We study their mentality to know who they are, what they do, and how they talk. Then we create reverse‑engineering messages that guide them toward ethics. We want to catch them before they fall, or help them climb back if they've already fallen.

## 3. Companies
Organizations that need skilled security talent. We offer them a pool of self‑taught individuals who have proven themselves through volunteer work and have a clear progress record. Companies get interested because they see real experience, not just certificates. Our research also provides them with short solutions to urgent problems.

## 4. Governments
Nations that need ethical hackers they can trust. By guiding hackers to ethics, we help create a talent pool that governments can use in official programs – instead of trapping or criminalizing curious minds.

We serve all four because they are connected. Fix one, and the others still suffer. Fix all, and the ecosystem heals.
