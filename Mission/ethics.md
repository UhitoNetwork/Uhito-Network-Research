# Our Ethics

Knowledge is not a crime. Intent is.

We understand hacking techniques. We know how attacks work – step by step. But we never use those skills to harm anyone. Our intent is protection.

**Our ethical principles:**

- We do not harm.
- We do not steal.
- We do not trespass (digital or physical).
- We do not expose others to risk.
- We share knowledge to empower, not to enable.
- We guide hackers toward ethics without trapping them.

We study attackers so we can stop them. We learn their tools so we can build defenses. We keep our ethics because once you cross that line, it's hard to come back.

We are ethical. We are legal. This is our line.
