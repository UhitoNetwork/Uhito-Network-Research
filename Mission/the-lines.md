# The Lines We Draw

Every hacker walks a path. Some lead to discovery and protection. Others lead to destruction and prison.

We draw the lines clearly:

- **Curiosity vs. Crime**  
  Testing a system you own is learning. Testing a system you don't own is breaking the law.

- **Testing vs. Destruction**  
  Finding a vulnerability is skill. Exploiting it to cause harm is destruction.

- **Freedom vs. Prison**  
  A moment of rebellion can cost years of your life. The thrill fades. The record stays.

- **Knowledge vs. Intent**  
  Knowing how an attack works is not a crime. Using that knowledge to harm someone is.

We show these lines not to scare, but to arm with truth. If someone still chooses the dark, it will be with open eyes. But we hope many will choose to fix, not break.
