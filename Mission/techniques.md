# Our Techniques

We use specific techniques to reach hackers and guide them toward ethics. These methods are built on years of research into hacker mentality, how they think, and what drives them.

---

## 1. Simulation Books

We create books where every hacker sees himself.

When a hacker reads our stories, he falls into them. The characters feel real because they are built from real research – who hackers are, what they do, how they talk, what drives them. The reader walks through the story, faces choices, and experiences consequences.

By the end, the story leads him to one of two paths:
- Turn to ethics
- Start legal learning

He doesn't feel preached to. He feels like he lived it. That is the power of simulation.

## 2. Interactive Scenarios (Future Website)

We are building a website that takes our book stories and turns them into **multi‑scenario experiences**.

The reader faces questions at key moments. Each choice leads to a different branch – different consequences, different endings. This is not just reading; it's living the hacker journey in a safe space.

The website will:
- Present real‑world situations hackers face
- Let them choose their path
- Show the outcomes of good and bad choices
- Guide them toward ethics through experience, not lectures

---

## 3. Reverse Social Engineering

We study how hackers talk, what motivates them, and what they value. Then we craft messages that speak directly to them – using their own language, their own logic – and gently redirect that energy toward good.

This is not manipulation for harm. This is guidance using the same psychological principles they encounter in the dark, but turned toward light.

---

## 4. Simple Language Awareness

For the community, we strip away technical jargon. We speak in words everyone understands – videos, posters, simple messages – so normal people can protect themselves without needing a cybersecurity degree.

---

## 5. Volunteer Content Creation

We ask volunteers to create their own awareness content – videos, posters, simple messages – to help others avoid digital harm. This does two things:
- The community gets protection in simple language
- The volunteers build a public record of their work

That record becomes proof for companies and governments that they can communicate, educate, and protect.

---

## 6. Documentation as Proof

Every technique, every study, every failure is documented. This serves as:
- Our memory
- Our shield if questioned
- Proof of work for volunteers seeking opportunities

---

These techniques are our tools. They come from research, are tested through study, delivered through awareness, and multiplied through volunteers. This is how we fix.
