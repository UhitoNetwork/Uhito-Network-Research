# Founder Story: Why Uhito Network Exists

As founder of Uhito Network, my days have not been easy. I almost cried because I felt like I was wasting a lot of time on a project that could be helpful to others. What hurts is that I'm the one who needs to pay the bills while creating this project. I need money. I had to tell myself: without cash, I can't do this. I tried hard.

I used all my courage just to give it to you guys for free. That decision pushed me to try to make something bigger without breaking the law. I see myself as a researcher who wants to fix mentality. I want to guide those who have fallen into wrong ethical or legal destinations. Fighting for good is not shameful.

I feel bad because I'm doing a good thing for free, not expecting many visitors—but hoping for people who care enough to develop it further. I tried hard to make it simple so maybe other research centers can use it and develop it more.

## What Moved Me

I have seen a lot of people get stolen from. I see them cry. I see them suffering—in real life, on social media, or just in my imagination. The government can't help them. The services can't either. They are just lost.

So Uhito Network came to my mind: to teach people the techniques for avoiding having their information stolen. The goal is for the community to help itself—not as false hope, but as a model for knowing what to do. And for those who want to help, they can use these same modules like I do, to make our voice louder and decrease the number of these cases.

## The Name

Uhito means Unknown Hacker in the operation. Not to harm you, but to lead you to ethic or legal learning. Uhito changes people's mindset to understand the threat and begin moving away from it.

## The Four Repositories

- **Research** — To know the enemy, to understand how they think and operate
- **Learn** — To document my journey so others can follow the same path
- **Awareness** — To help people avoid sharing their information and spot danger
- **Volunteer** — To build a community of people who want to help protect others

## Why I Built This

I built this because someone had to.

Not the government. Not the services. Someone who saw the problem and decided to stop waiting.

I built this for:
- The ones who got stolen from
- The ones who haven't yet but might
- The ones who want to help but don't know how
- The ones who lost their way and need a path back
- The community that deserves to protect itself

## The Truth

I'm still struggling. Still paying bills. Still figuring it out.

But I'm still here. Still building. Still hoping that someone who cares will help develop this further.

Using this story, I wanted to organize the message and make it look professional. Nothing more—just link everything together and give the best version.

Fighting for good is not shameful.
