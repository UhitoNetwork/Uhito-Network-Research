# Rules Don't Apply: Why Hackers Ignore Laws & Terms

## Key Points
- Digital space is perceived as "lawless" or self-regulated territory
- Terms of Service (ToS) and licensing agreements are rarely read or respected
- Common justification: "If they didn't want me in, they should have better security"
- Anonymity tools (VPNs, cryptocurrencies) create illusion of invincibility
- Many young hackers are genuinely unaware of computer crime laws
- The line between "curious exploration" and "criminal trespass" becomes blurred over time

## Real-world Effect
What begins as innocent curiosity ("Can I do this?") evolves into systematic trespass, then criminal activity — often without the individual ever self-identifying as a criminal. By the time legal consequences arrive, the psychological justification system is firmly established.

## Investigation Questions
1. Did you ever read the Terms of Service before accessing a system without permission?
2. When did you first realize that what you were doing might be illegal?
3. Do you think laws written before the digital age still apply to online activities?
4. Does using privacy tools (VPN, Tor) make you feel above legal consequences?
5. Have you ever been caught or faced consequences? Were you surprised by the severity?
6. What would make digital laws feel more relevant or legitimate to you?
