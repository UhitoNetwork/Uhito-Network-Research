# Information > Money: The True Currency of Hackers

## Key Points
- For many hackers, access trumps cash; secrets equal status
- Knowledge is power, and exclusive knowledge is supreme power
- Underground reputation is built on what you know/can do, not what you earn
- Exclusive tools, techniques, and zero-days are often traded, not sold
- Insider access to systems/data is more valuable than monetary payment
- The thrill of knowing "forbidden" information drives continuous exploration

## Real-world Effect
Organizations can engage hacker talent through controlled information sharing rather than purely financial incentives. Offering security clearances, threat intelligence, or early technology access can build loyalty deeper than any employment contract.

## Investigation Questions
1. What's more valuable: $1,000 or administrative access to a major corporation's network?
2. Have you ever shared hacking techniques for free, just for community recognition?
3. Would you work with authorities if they gave you access to classified cyber threat data?
4. Is "being in the know" more important than "being paid well" in your community?
5. What kind of information would make you trust an organization enough to work with them?
6. Have you ever turned down money for a hack because the information wasn't interesting enough?
