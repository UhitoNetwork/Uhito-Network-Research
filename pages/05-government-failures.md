# Government Failures: How Systems Create Enemies

## Key Points
- Governments treat hackers as criminals first, potential assets last
- Common approach: entrapment (teach then arrest) rather than engagement
- No clear pathways from illicit hacking to legitimate cybersecurity careers
- Laws are punitive rather than preventative or rehabilitative
- Little to no early intervention in schools or online communities
- Cybersecurity recruitment often excludes self-taught or unconventional candidates

## Real-world Effect
Governments waste national talent, push skilled youth toward criminal ecosystems, and create deep distrust that fuels further anti-establishment hacking. The cycle continues as each generation learns to see authorities as adversaries rather than allies.

## Investigation Questions
1. Do you trust your government's approach to cybersecurity and hackers? Why?
2. Have you ever been approached by someone who later turned out to be law enforcement?
3. Would you consider working for the government if offered training and a clean slate?
4. What could governments do to make hackers feel like assets rather than threats?
5. Are cyber laws in your country fair, or do they criminalize curiosity and learning?
6. Have you ever reported a vulnerability only to be threatened with legal action?
