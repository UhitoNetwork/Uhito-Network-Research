# Emotional Fuel: How Rejection & Revenge Drive Hackers

## Key Points
- Personal rejection (social, romantic, professional) → digital power reclamation
- Systemic rejection (excluded from tech jobs/education) → targeting corporations/governments
- Revenge hacking often follows disproportionate logic: small slight → major breach
- Ideological framing: "They are corrupt, so I am justified in exposing them"
- The digital realm offers a power reversal for those who feel powerless offline
- Anonymous attacks allow for catharsis without accountability

## Real-world Effect
Hackers who feel personally or systemically wronged become digital vigilantes. Their targets may include individuals, companies, or institutions perceived as responsible for their suffering. Innocent parties often become collateral damage in what the hacker views as "justice."

## Investigation Questions
1. Have you ever hacked someone who personally wronged or rejected you?
2. Did you ever feel excluded from legitimate tech communities or job opportunities?
3. Does hacking make you feel powerful when other areas of life make you feel powerless?
4. Where do you draw the line between "seeking justice" and "seeking revenge"?
5. If you had been accepted into tech communities earlier, would you have hacked differently?
6. Have you ever regretted a hack motivated by emotion rather than curiosity?
